## Introduction to Li-Fi
Li-Fi (also written as LiFi) acronym for Light Fidelity is a wireless communication technology which utilizes light to transmit data and position between devices. 
It is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over the visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared spectrums. In its present state, only LED lamps can be used for the transmission of data in visible light. In terms of its end use, the technology is similar to Wi-Fi — the key technical difference being that Wi-Fi uses radio frequency to induce a voltage in an antenna to transmit data, whereas Li-Fi uses the modulation of light intensity to transmit data. Li-Fi can theoretically transmit at speeds of up to 100 Gbit/s. Li-Fi's ability to safely function in areas otherwise susceptible to electromagnetic interference (e.g. aircraft cabins, hospitals, military) is an advantage. The technology is being developed by several organizations across the globe.

## Building the Li-Fi Modulator
The Red Pitaya has 2 Fast Analog RF Outputs as shown below in the block diagram:

- The laser diode can transmit light pulses only in digital form, that is 1s and 0s, it's a 1 if the laser diode is ON and it's a 0 if the laser diode is OFF.
- The specification of the RF Outputs are ± 1V Max. amplitude and DC-40MHz.
- Thus, to power the Laser Module, a transistor is used as a switch.
